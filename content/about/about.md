I am a physicist and a scientist by training, having worked in projects spanning from materials design to supporting astrophysics and particle physics research. I am curious to understand why natural processes happen in certain ways, but also to explore the infinite universe of the mind and its creative outcomes. I usually try to convey the interpretation of my surroundings and my ideas through photographic and video practices. 

Extremely passionate about cinema and documentaries, I am looking to get involved in projects of this sort. On the side, I am also exporing the connection between art and technology by studying computer graphics visualisation and generative art practices in my free time. 

When not behind a computer screen, I read anything I find, climb steep monutain walls, swim in icy cold rivers, dance at any time of the day and night and always look for new friendly interactions to share ideas and expand my imagination.

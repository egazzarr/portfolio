A physicist and a scientist by training, Elena has worked on projects spanning from materials design to supporting astrophysics and particle physics research. Curious to understand how natural processes happen in certain ways, but also to explore the infinite universe of the mind and its creative outcomes, she tries to convey the interpretation of her surroundings in a visual way through photos and videos. 

She transitioned from academic solid state physics research to managing infrastructures for Open Science and Open Data in the IT department at CERN, with the objective of making Dark Matter searches more collaborative and sustainable. She contributed to <a href="https://rucio.cern.ch/team.html" target="_blank" style="color: orange;">software projects at CERN </a>, making them available on a single platform (the <a href="https://vre-hub.github.io/" target="_blank" style="color: orange;">Virtual Research Environment</a>) not only to particle physicists (<a href="https://home.cern/fr/science/experiments/atlas" target="_blank" style="color: orange;">ATLAS</a>, <a href="https://home.cern/fr/science/experiments/cms" target="_blank" style="color: orange;">CMS</a>), but also to astrophysicists (<a href="https://www.skao.int/en/about-us/skao" target="_blank" style="color: orange;">SKAO</a>, <a href="https://www.cta-observatory.org/" target="_blank" style="color: orange;">CTA</a>), neutrino physicists (<a href="https://www.km3net.org/" target="_blank" style="color: orange;">KM3NeT</a>, <a href="https://www.lngs.infn.it/en/darkside" target="_blank" style="color: orange;">Darkside</a>) and gravitational waves physicists (<a href="https://www.einsteintelescope.nl/en/" target="_blank" style="color: orange;">Einstein Telescope</a>, <a href="https://www.ego-gw.it/" target="_blank" style="color: orange;">EGO</a>) working at various institutions across Europe. 

Always passionate about visual communication, cinema and documentaries, she is currently involved in producing educational and <a href="https://egazzarr.github.io/data-centre-history/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: orange;">exhibition content</a> with the CERN MediaLAB, merging science, technology and art.  

When not behind a computer screen, Elena likes to climb steep monutain walls, swim in icy cold rivers, dance at any time of the day and night and always looks for ways to be creative, share ideas and expand imagination.

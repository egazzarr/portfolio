While travelling around the arid, deserted, dusty areas of the world, one is hit by a feeling of desolation. Overwhelmed by natureâ€™s power, we see human - made constructions reverting back to where they belong - the earth itself.

This series reveals humans presence in unusual environments and his ability to adapt and coexist with them.
It highlights the contrasts between humans and wilderness and how the latter always ends up establishing its dominion.

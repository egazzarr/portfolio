## Portfolio website

Code to generate a simple portfolio website with my photography projects. 
Live at https://egazzarr.github.io/portfolio/. 
The deployment and build is activated through github pages on the 'right' branch. 
The website is built with [hugo](https://gohugo.io); if you are interested in replicating this, follow the documentation of the [sourdough](https://github.com/Jack-alope/sourgough-starter).

      <description>I am a physicist and a scientist by training, having worked in projects spanning from materials design to supporting astrophysics and particle physics research. I am curious to understand why natural processes happen in certain ways, but also to explore the infinite universe of the mind and its creative outcomes. I usually try to convey the interpretation of my surroundings and my ideas through photographic and video practices.
Extremely passionate about cinema and documentaries, I am looking to get involved in projects of this sort.</description>
